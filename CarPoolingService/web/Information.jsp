<h4>Carpooling Helps Save You Money</h4>
<p>You can save money on gas and such by diving up the gas fees among your carpool passengers. 
The more people you have the more you can save. Carpooling also helps you save on the cost of vehicle repairs and maintenance
if you rotate vehicle use between the members of your carpool team. Additionally, you and everyone else can save some money on road fees 
because with more carpooling there are fewer cars on the road and therefore less wear and damage to the roads that need to be repaired each
year using taxpayerâ€™s money.</p>

<h4>Carpooling Helps the Environment</h4>
<p>Carpooling cuts down on the number of cars and vehicle son the road. Fewer cars means there is less carbon and other gasses and pollution getting into the air.
    This protects the environment by keeping the air, water, and land cleaner.</p>

<h4>It is Good for You</h4>
<p>According to numerous health reports and research, air pollution caused by auto emissions can significantly increase the likelihood of health issues such as 
asthma, allergies, lung cancer, COPD, and the like. Research data has also suggested that carpooling can be far less stressful than simply commuting on your own.

<h4>Carpooling is a Very Convenient Option</h4>
<p>Carpooling is an option that can give you great flexibility. If you need to carpool three days a week or five, you can do so. Whatever your needs are,
you can look for people who need that same schedule or who can add you to their drive route on the days you need a ride. The flexibility makes it a very convenient option for any long commute.
